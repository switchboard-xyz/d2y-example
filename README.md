## Prerequisites

Before you can build and run the project, you'll need to have Docker installed on your system. Docker allows you to package and distribute applications as lightweight containers, making it easy to manage dependencies and ensure consistent behavior across different environments. Switchboard Functions are built and run within containers, so you'll need a docker daemon running to publish a new function.

### Installing Docker

If you don't have Docker installed, you can follow these steps to get it up and running:

1. **Linux**: Depending on your Linux distribution, you might need to use different package managers. For Ubuntu, you can use `apt`:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install docker.io
   ```

   For other distributions, consult your package manager's documentation.

2. **macOS**: You can install Docker Desktop for macOS by downloading the installer from the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and following the installation instructions.

3. **Windows**: Similarly, you can install Docker Desktop for Windows from the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and follow the provided instructions.

### Docker Setup

After installing Docker, make sure it's running by opening a terminal/command prompt and running:

```bash
docker --version
```

This should display the installed Docker version, confirming that Docker is installed and running properly.

You'll need to login to docker. If you don't yet have an account, you'll need one to publish images to dockerhub. You can sign up at [https://hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com).

```bash
docker login --username <your-username> --password <your-password>
```

### Install script dependencies

```bash
pnpm i
```

### Install Switchboard cli

```bash
pnpm i -g @switchboard-xyz/cli@3.2.13-alpha0.0.14
sb evm function --help
```

## Components

### Contract

This example contract acts as the ingester of the switchboard-function in this directory to fetch implied volatility parameters via deribit. The example contract is an example of the [ERC2535 diamond contract pattern](https://autifynetwork.com/exploring-erc-2535-the-diamond-standard-for-smart-contracts/) so it can be extended and upgraded for your needs.

When you deploy this contract, it will await to be bound to a switchboard function calling into it.

#### Picking a network and setting up your environment

- set the `SWITCHBOARD_ADDRESS` env variable to target whichever address is appropriate for the network you're targeting
- for arbitrum testnet, this is: `0xA3c9F9F6E40282e1366bdC01C1D30F7F7F58888e`

To first deploy the contract, run:

```bash
# ex:
# pnpm deploy:coredaotestnet
# pnpm deploy:coredaomain
# pnpm deploy:arbitrumtestnet
pnpm deploy:${NETWORK_NAME}
```

More deploy commands are available in [package.json](./package.json) scripts.

You will see the last line of this script output

```bash
export CALLBACK_ADDRESS=<RECEIVER_ADDRESS>
```

### Switchboard Function

Export the address to your environment and navigate to `./switchboard-function/`

The bulk of the function logic can be found in [./switchboard-function/src/main.rs](switchboard-function/src/main.rs).

Build functions from the `switchboard-function/` directory with

```bash
cd switchboard-function
make build
```

### Publishing and Initialization

You'll also need to pick a container name that your switchboard function will use on dockerhub.

```bash
export CONTAINER_NAME=your_docker_username/switchboard-function
export CALLBACK_ADDRESS=<RECEIVER_ADDRESS>
```

Here, set the name of your container and deploy it using:

```bash
cd switchboard-function
export CONTAINER_NAME=your_docker_username/switchboard-function
export CALLBACK_ADDRESS=<RECEIVER_ADDRESS>
make publish
```

Common gotcha: make sure this published container is publically visible

After this is published, you are free to make your function account to set the rate of run for the function.

You'll also need to create a file with your private key in it. This is used to sign the transactions that will be sent to the switchboard contract.

### Initializing the function

You can use the Switchboard cli to bind this docker container to an on-chain representation:

```bash
export SWITCHBOARD_ADDRESS_ARBITRUM_TESTNET=0xA3c9F9F6E40282e1366bdC01C1D30F7F7F58888e
export QUEUE_ID=0x54f8A91bE5baAD3E2368b00A11bF4012EA6b031F # default testnet queue
export MEASUREMENT=<YOUR CONTAINER MEASUREMENT>
sb evm function create $QUEUE_ID --container ${CONTAINER_NAME} --containerRegistry dockerhub  --mrEnclave ${MEASUREMENT?} --name "options_example"  --chain arbitrum --account /path/to/signer --network testnet --programId $SWITCHBOARD_ADDRESS_ARBITRUM_TESTNET
...
export FUNCTION_ID=<YOUR FUNCTION ID>
sb evm routine create $FUNCTION_ID --chain $CHAIN --schedule "*/10 * * * * *" --account /path/to/keypair --network $CLUSTER --programId $SWITCHBOARD_ADDRESS_ARBITRUM_TESTNET --params="YOUR_CALL_PARAMS"
...
export ROUTINE_ID=<YOUR ROUTINE ID>
sb evm routine fund ${ROUTINE_ID?} --chain $CHAIN --fundAmount 0.01 --account /path/to/keypair --network $CLUSTER --programId $SWITCHBOARD_ADDRESS_ARBITRUM_TESTNET
```

### Printing the state of your callback

This repo contains an example script to view the current verified deribit implied volatility info
currently in contract:

```bash
npx hardhat run --network arbitrumTestnet scripts/get_state.ts
```

## Writing Switchboard Rust Functions

In order to write a successfully running switchboard function, you'll need to import `switchboard-evm` to use the libraries which communicate the function results (which includes transactions to run) to the Switchboard Verifiers that execute these metatransactions.

### Setup

Cargo.toml

```toml
[package]
name = "function-name"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[[bin]]
name = "function-name"
path = "src/main.rs"

[dependencies]
tokio = "^1"
futures = "0.3"

# at a minimum you'll need to include the following packages
ethers = { version = "2.0.7", features = ["legacy"] }
switchboard-evm = "0.5.0"
```

### Minimal Switchboard Function

main.rs

```rust
use ethers::prelude::*;
use ethers::{
    prelude::{abigen, SignerMiddleware},
    providers::{Http, Provider},
    types::Address,
};
use futures::TryFutureExt;
use rust_decimal::prelude::FromPrimitive;
use rust_decimal::Decimal;
use serde::Deserialize;
use switchboard_evm::sdk::EVMFunctionRunner;
use switchboard_evm::*;
pub use switchboard_utils::reqwest;

abigen!(Receiver, r#"[ function callback(int256, uint256) ]"#,);
static CLIENT_URL: &str = "https://goerli-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc";
static RECEIVER: &str = env!("CALLBACK_ADDRESS");

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct DeribitRespnseInner {
    pub mark_iv: f64,
    pub timestamp: u64,
}
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
pub struct DeribitResponse {
    pub result: DeribitRespnseInner,
}

#[sb_function(expiration_seconds = 120, gas_limit = 5_500_000)]
async fn sb_function<M: Middleware, S: Signer>(
    client: SignerMiddleware<M, S>,
    _: NoParams,
) -> Result<Vec<FnCall<M, S>>, Error> {
    let receiver: Address = RECEIVER.parse().map_err(|_| Error::ParseError)?;
    let receiver_contract = Receiver::new(receiver, client.into());

    // --- Logic Below ---
    let url = "https://www.deribit.com/api/v2/public/get_order_book?instrument_name=ETH-29SEP23-2000-C";
    let derebit_response: DeribitResponse = reqwest::get(url)
        .and_then(|r| r.json())
        .await
        .map_err(|_| Error::FetchError)?;

    let timestamp = derebit_response.result.timestamp.into();
    let mut mark_iv =
        Decimal::from_f64(derebit_response.result.mark_iv).ok_or(Error::ParseError)?;
    mark_iv.rescale(8);
    let callback = receiver_contract.callback(mark_iv.mantissa().into(), timestamp);

    // --- Send the callback to the contract with Switchboard verification ---
    Ok(vec![callback])
}

#[sb_error]
enum Error {
    ParseError = 1,
    FetchError,
}
```

### Testing your function

We can't guarantee that the function will run on the blockchain, but we can test that it compiles and runs locally.

Run the following to test your function:

```bash
sb evm function test --parameters uint256:0 --chain arbitrum --network testnet
```

Successful output:

```bash
WARNING: Error generating quote. Function will not be able to be transmitted correctly.

```

The `error` above simply means your function could not produce a secure signature for the test since it was run outside the enclave.

### Deploying and Maintenance

After you publish the function and create it on the blockchain, you must keep the function escrow account funded to cover gas fees. Revisions to the function can be made by deploying a new version and updating the function config on-chain.

## Writing Receiver Contracts

While Switchboard Functions can call back into any number of on-chain functions, it's useful to limit access to some privileged functions to just _your_ Switchboard Function.

In order to do this you'll need to know the switchboard address you're using, and which functionId will be calling into the function in question.

### Receiver Example

Recipient.sol

```sol

// Get the Switchboard Library - this is the Core Mainnet Deployment, you can swap this for one of the networks below
import {SwitchboardCallbackHandler} from "@switchboard-xyz/evm.js/contracts/SwitchboardCallbackHandler.sol";

contract Receiver is SwitchboardCallbackHandler {
    address public switchboard;
    address public functionID;

    function callback(
        int256 data,
        uint256 timestamp
    ) external isSwitchboardCaller isFunctionId {
        // Set function id on first callback
        address _functionId = getEncodedFunctionId();
        if (functionId == address(0)) {
            functionId = _functionId;
        }

        ReceiverLib.callback(data, timestamp);
    }

    function viewData() external view returns (int256, uint256) {
        return ReceiverLib.viewData();
    }

    // SwitchboardCallbackHandler functions integrated below

    function getSwithboardAddress() internal view override returns (address) {
        return switchboard;
    }

    function getSwitchboardFunctionId()
        internal
        view
        override
        returns (address)
    {
        return functionId;
    }

    // Our own function to get the encoded function id manually

    function getEncodedFunctionId() internal pure returns (address) {
        if (msg.data.length < 20) {
            revert SwitchboardCallbackHandler__MissingFunctionId();
        }

        address receivedFunctionId;
        assembly {
            receivedFunctionId := shr(96, calldataload(sub(calldatasize(), 20)))
        }
        return receivedFunctionId;
    }
}
```
